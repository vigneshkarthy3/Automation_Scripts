# Automation_Scripts
To get all the github commits from all the brances from a repo.
==> get_all_githubcommits.py
Go through and run with any repo. 
You can also provide filter by any date since or until changing the params, to get the commit list.

I have made the script run and save in a sqlite db.

### Similiarly, there are multiple scripts that will be useful for creating pipelines, interactive slackbots, selenium screenshot, and Cloud Foundry automations 
 

### ----------Automation is the key to end boring tasks ;)-------------
